### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research group leader in Germany (FSU Jena, Helmholtz Center for Polymers in Energy Applications) looking into how data can be used to expedite materials design and discovery. 
For this, I'm also looking into ways in how we can improve data capture and dissemination in experimental chemistry.
