### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [research group leader in Germany (FSU Jena, Helmholtz Center for Polymers in Energy Applications)](https://www.jablonkagroup.uni-jena.de/) looking into how data can be used to expedite materials design and discovery. I've been developing [tools for MOFs](https://mof.world), but also generally applicable [ML](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/gptchem) [systems](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/pyepal).
For this, I'm also looking into ways to improve data capture and dissemination in experimental chemistry. For example, I've been [collecting interesting datasets](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/awesome-chemistry-datasets) that we are now using to train a chemistry LLM, in the [ChemNLP project](https://github.com/OpenBioML/chemnlp), that I co-lead.
