### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [research group leader in Germany (FSU Jena, Helmholtz Center for Polymers in Energy Applications)](https://www.jablonkagroup.uni-jena.de/) looking into how data can be used to expedite materials design and discovery. 
For this, I'm also looking into ways to improve data capture and dissemination in experimental chemistry.
